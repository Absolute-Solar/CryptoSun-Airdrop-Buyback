## üåû Overview

The CryptoSun Airdrop & Buyback repository contains smart contracts and tools for managing the distribution and circulation of Solar Energy Tokens (SETs) within the CryptoSun ecosystem. This module is specifically designed to:

- Implement fair and transparent token distribution mechanisms through airdrops
- Execute strategic token buybacks to stabilize token value
- Support liquidity provision and market making for SETs
- Provide incentives for early adopters and community contributors

## üîë Key Features

- **Merkle Tree Airdrops**: Efficient, gas-optimized token distribution using cryptographic proofs
- **Scheduled Distributions**: Time-based and milestone-based token releases
- **Automatic Buybacks**: Smart contract-managed token repurchases based on market conditions
- **Liquidity Incentives**: Rewards for liquidity providers in partner exchanges
- **Multi-chain Support**: Compatible with multiple blockchain networks
- **Governance Integration**: Community voting for airdrop parameters and buyback thresholds
- **Stake-to-Earn**: Staking mechanisms with targeted rewards for solar energy participants

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Architecture

The airdrop and buyback system is composed of the following components:

1. **Eligibility Engine**: Determines recipient eligibility based on configurable criteria
2. **Distribution Contracts**: Manages the token distribution process
3. **Buyback Treasury**: Holds funds dedicated to token repurchases
4. **Market Oracle**: Provides price feed data for buyback decisions
5. **Strategy Controller**: Implements buyback strategies and timing

## üîß Smart Contracts

The repository includes the following core contracts:

- `MerkleDistributor.sol`: Efficient distribution using Merkle proofs
- `VestedAirdrop.sol`: Time-locked token distribution with vesting schedules
- `AutomaticBuyback.sol`: Autonomous token repurchase from markets
- `TreasuryManager.sol`: Management of funds allocated for buybacks
- `LiquidityRewardsVault.sol`: Rewards for liquidity providers
- `StakingRewards.sol`: Staking functionality with customized reward mechanics

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js v16+
- Hardhat
- Solidity v0.8.x
- MetaMask or other Web3 wallet

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/Absolute-Solar/cryptosun-airdrop-buyback.git
cd cryptosun-airdrop-buyback

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy to local network
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory:

```
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key
INFURA_API_KEY=your_infura_api_key
ETHERSCAN_API_KEY=your_etherscan_api_key
MERKLE_ROOT=merkle_root_for_airdrop
BUYBACK_THRESHOLD=price_trigger_for_buybacks
```

## üìä Airdrop Mechanics

CryptoSun implements a multi-phase airdrop strategy:

1. **Genesis Airdrop**: Rewards early adopters and community contributors
2. **Solar Producer Incentives**: Rewards based on verified solar capacity
3. **Community Growth Pool**: Ongoing distribution to encourage ecosystem participation
4. **Referral Rewards**: Incentives for bringing new participants to the ecosystem

Eligibility is determined through a transparent criteria system, including:
- Existing solar panel ownership (verified through partner integrations)
- Community participation and contribution metrics
- Early adoption of CryptoSun marketplace features
- Strategic partner allocations

## üí∞ Buyback Strategy

The buyback mechanism includes:

- **Automatic Triggers**: Price-based automated buybacks when tokens fall below certain thresholds
- **Manual Governance**: Community-approved strategic buybacks
- **Scheduled Operations**: Regular buybacks at predetermined intervals
- **Deflationary Mechanics**: Partial token burning from buybacks
- **Staking Rewards**: Distribution of buyback tokens to stakers

## üîí Security

The system implements several security measures:

- Smart contract audits by independent security firms
- Multi-signature requirements for treasury operations
- Time-locked execution for large buyback operations
- Rate limiting for large transactions
- Emergency pause functionality for critical situations

## üåê Use Cases

- **Solar Energy Producers**: Earn additional tokens based on production capacity
- **Early Adopters**: Receive incentives for early platform participation
- **Community Contributors**: Earn rewards for ecosystem contributions
- **Long-term Holders**: Benefit from value appreciation through buyback operations
- **Liquidity Providers**: Earn rewards for supporting token liquidity

## üîÆ Future Roadmap

1. **Q3 2025**: Launch of Genesis Airdrop for early supporters
2. **Q4 2025**: Implementation of automated buyback mechanism
3. **Q1 2026**: Introduction of staking rewards tied to solar production
4. **Q2 2026**: Cross-chain airdrop support for expanded ecosystem
5. **Q3 2026**: DAO governance for community-directed buybacks
